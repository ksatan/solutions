# Project Drawdown Model Engine

[Project Drawdown](https://www.drawdown.org/) is the most comprehensive plan yet published for how to solve Global Warming. Project Drawdown entered the climate conversation with the [publication of the 2017 book](https://www.drawdown.org/the-book). With [The Drawdown Review in 2020](https://drawdown.org/drawdown-framework/drawdown-review-2020), the project continues its mission to inspire and communicate solutions.

The Drawdown solution models are, at their core, economic models which estimate the total global and regional demand for each solution and the percentage of that demand each year which might adopt the Drawdown solution. The monetary and emissions impacts of that adoption are then calculated.  The framework and methodology for the model was developed by a core research team at Project Drawdown with senior research fellows and visiting researchers from each of the relevant solution domains, over the course of a number of years. The models were originally constructed in some ~80 Excel files.

This repository is a conversion of the original Excel models into python.  This includes both the analytical parts of the model, and the summary data used to produce key results.
Our goal is to enable:
   + ongoing research by Project Drawdown and other researchers
   + use of this research in other projects, including a broader audience of policy makers, business leaders, and other interested parties.
Future updates to the research will be published in this repository.

Whilst this repo covers the model and analytics in the form of a python library, our [sister project](https://github.com/ProjectDrawdown/global-research-platform) develops that into a server-based solution and a researcher-aimed UI.

## Status

Conversion Status:
  * Most of the solutions (technologies) have been converted.  The remaining include some technologies (such as those related to Food systems and Oceans) that use different methodology.
  * New solutions are converted as they become released from Project Drawdown research.
  * Almost all of the "core calculations" (which generate the main results) have been completed.
  * Most of the "secondary calculations" (which are used to do solution-specific generation of, e.g. emissions factors or adoption estimates) are _not_ yet implemented.
  * The overall integration between multiple solution models (used to model, for example, the impact of adopton of one solution on demand for another) has not yet been implemented.

Other work in progress:
  * Continuing work to make the interfaces more accessible to folks outside the Project Drawdown community, both in terms of code improvements and documentation.
  * Additional and upgraded analytics for some areas (e.g. greenhouse-gas calculation updates)

# Using the code

## Getting the source code

1. Get a copy of this source code:
```sh
      $ git clone https://github.com/ProjectDrawdown/solutions.git
      $ cd solutions
      $ git checkout develop
```

## Development/Deployment environment

There are two requirements files, depending on how you want to set up your environment:

  1. `requirements.txt` is a [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/) requirements file with a minimal set of dependencies
```sh
      $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  2. `environment.yml` is a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) environment definition which includes a broader set of packages, notably including [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/):
```sh
      $ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

The conda environment is recommended for exploring the code and doing development, while the pip deployment is better for deployment as a package.
If you are installing Conda for this first time, we recommend [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) as it is a lighter-weight tool.

## Using Project Drawdown Solutions as a package

If you would like to use this project as a dependency in _your_ code, you can do so by including the following line in your requirements.txt file:

```
      git+git://github.com/ProjectDrawdown/solutions@develop
```
